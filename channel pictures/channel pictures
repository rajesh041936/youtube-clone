The channel-pictures folder contains profile images of the YouTube channels featured in the video grid. 
These images are displayed next to each video thumbnail to visually represent the content creator, mimicking the layout of the actual YouTube interface.
Each image is used as part of the video card design to enhance realism and provide a more complete clone of the platform's appearance.

All images are statically linked in the HTML and styled with CSS for consistent sizing and alignment within the video information section.
