The styles folder contains all the CSS files responsible for styling the YouTube clone interface. 
Each CSS file is modularized to target specific sections of the layout, making the code more organized, readable, and maintainable.
This separation of concerns allows for easier updates and scalability as the project grows.

general.css: Contains global styles, CSS resets, font imports, and utility classes used throughout the project.

header.css: Styles the top navigation bar, including the logo, search bar, icons, and tooltip hover effects.

sidebar.css: Handles the layout and appearance of the vertical sidebar, including icon alignment and hover interactions.

video.css: Defines the grid layout for video previews and styles for thumbnails, channel pictures, and video metadata.

This folder ensures the visual structure and aesthetics of the clone closely resemble the real YouTube interface using only HTML and CSS.
