# youtube-clone

This project is a front-end clone of the YouTube homepage, developed using pure HTML and CSS. It is intended as a practice project to strengthen foundational web development skills by recreating the structure and layout of a well-known user interface.

The design replicates key components of YouTube’s interface, including a responsive header with a search bar and icons, a collapsible sidebar with navigation links, and a video grid displaying thumbnails, titles, channel information, and view statistics. The layout is built using modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox and Grid, and styled with attention to detail to resemble YouTube’s clean and user-friendly aesthetic.

All assets including icons, thumbnails, and profile pictures are organized in separate folders for easy project maintenance and scalability. This clone focuses purely on static design and does not include interactivity or functionality like video playback or search logic.

This project is ideal for those learning front-end development and aiming to improve their skills in creating structured, maintainable, and visually accurate web interfaces.
