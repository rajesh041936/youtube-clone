The thumbnails folder contains the preview images (thumbnails) for each video displayed in the main video grid of the YouTube clone interface. 
These images represent the video content visually, similar to how YouTube showcases videos on its homepage.
Each thumbnail is paired with video metadata such as the title, channel name, view count, and duration to simulate a realistic and familiar layout.

The thumbnails are statically embedded in the HTML and styled with CSS to maintain consistent sizing, spacing, and alignment within the video preview cards.
